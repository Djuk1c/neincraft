### Project goal
~~Have a infinite procedurally generated world~~\
Be able to destroy and place blocks

### Todo  
Seperate thread for loading chunks\
Maybe hashmap instead of set for storing chunks?\
Highlight block when mousing over it (also for placing blocks)\
~~Play around with perlin parameters more to make it look more natural (Looks solid)~~\
~~Remove faces between chunks, and other faces that cant be seen~~\
~~Fix bug at spawn when there are 2x more chunks (Hacky)~~\
~~Store chunks on the heap as pointers so i can delete them~~\
~~Increase chunk height~~
